Phase 3 (Monetization + Controlled Creator Uploads)
Phase 3 is ads + controlled creator uploads together, implemented exactly as written below.
Do not implement features outside this scope.
Proceed with backend and admin groundwork only.
Context
This project already has:
Phase 1: Core platform ✅ 
Phase 2: Accounts + content depth ✔️ 
Phase 3 must extend Phases 1–2 without redesigning, refactoring, or altering existing UI/UX.
All Phase 3 functionality must be behind feature flags and not user-visible until Phase 2 is formally accepted.
Global Rules (Hard Constraints)
Do NOT redesign UI
Do NOT alter Theater Mode
Do NOT alter sliders, navigation, or branding
Do NOT expose any Phase 3 features publicly
Do NOT add subscriptions, payments, tips, or dashboards
Keep implementations minimal and internal
No speculative features
Phase 3 Purpose (Single Sentence)
Enable revenue generation and controlled creator uploads while preserving a premium, cinema-first experience.
1) Creator Uploads — Controlled Access (Required)
Access Model
No open uploads
No public creator signup
Creators are admin-approved only
Creator States
pending
approved
rejected
Creator Capabilities (Approved Only)
Upload videos using Mux direct upload
Provide metadata:
title
description
poster image
Assign exactly one category per title (same category rules as Phase 1/2)
Explicit Restrictions
Creators do NOT see:
revenue
analytics
ads
No creator dashboards beyond:
upload
submission status
2) Admin — Creator Control (Internal Only)
Admin must be able to:
Review creator applications
Approve or reject creators
Enable or disable monetization per title
Remove or hide creator content
Admin UI is internal only and minimal.
3) Monetization — Ads (Quiet Implementation)
Ad Type
Pre-roll only
No mid-roll
No post-roll
Controls
Admin toggle per title:
ads ON / OFF
Admin-set ad duration (e.g. 15–30 seconds)
UX Rules (Critical)
No homepage banners
No pop-ups
No loud countdown UI
No UI clutter
Ad plays before content, then a clean transition into the film
Theater Mode experience must remain intact
⚠️ Ads must be wired but disabled by default.
4) Event Tracking (Lightweight Only)
Track only the following events:
Content play
Content completion
Ad impression
Explicitly Do NOT Track
Earnings
Creator payouts
Detailed analytics
Viewer profiles
5) Player & UI Rules (Unchanged)
Theater Mode remains dominant
Sliders remain the primary navigation
Audio and video use the same overlay system
Branding rules remain unchanged
No UI modifications unless strictly required for internal admin tools.
6) Explicitly Out of Scope (DO NOT BUILD)
Subscriptions
Payments
Tips or donations
Mid-roll ads
Open uploads
Creator analytics dashboards
Social features
Any feature not listed above
7) Allowed Work During Phase 2 Overlap (Backend + Admin Only)
The following may be implemented behind feature flags and must not be exposed:
Backend / Infrastructure
Creator data model with status:
pending / approved / rejected
Creator application submission flow
Admin creator review and approval logic
Mux direct upload wiring for creators
Ad system wiring (pre-roll only, disabled)
Event tracking schema:
play events
completion events
ad impression events
Admin (Internal Only)
Admin UI to:
approve / reject creators
enable / disable ads per title
remove or hide creator content
8) Activation Rule
Phase 3 features must remain disabled
Activation occurs only after Phase 2 acceptance
Feature flags are mandatory
9) Acceptance Checkpoints (For Reference)
Checkpoint 1 — Creators
Creator application → admin approval flow works
Approved creators can upload and publish content
Checkpoint 2 — Ads
Pre-roll plays when enabled
No UI clutter
Clean transition into content
Checkpoint 3 — Tracking
Play events logged
Ad impression events logged
Final Instruction
Implement Phase 3 backend and admin groundwork only.
Do not expose Phase 3 functionality publicly.
