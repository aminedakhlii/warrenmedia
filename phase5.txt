Phase 5: Stability, Scale & App Readiness (Final Phase)
You are working on the final phase of a cinema-first streaming platform that already has:
Core viewing experience (Phase 1)
Accounts + content depth (Phase 2)
Monetization + creators (Phase 3)
Community (Phase 4)
⚠️ Phase 5 is NOT about new user-facing features.
It is about hardening, performance, reliability, and future readiness.
Before writing any code, analyze the existing architecture and produce a short plan describing:
What needs optimization
What needs protection
What needs preparation for scale and apps
Only then proceed with implementation.
Global Rules (Non-Negotiable)
No redesigns
No UI clutter
No new product features
No changes to Theater Mode behavior
No changes to slider/navigation logic
Ignore domain setup, DNS, and hosting wiring
Focus on code, data, performance, and reliability
If a task is infrastructure-only or operational (DNS, billing, legal), do not implement it.
Phase 5 Goals
Improve performance and reliability under load
Harden security and abuse protections
Prepare the codebase for mobile and TV apps
Add production-grade monitoring and diagnostics
1) PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (REQUIRED)
Homepage & Browsing
Optimize homepage data loading:
Add pagination or limits to rows
Avoid loading unused fields
Reduce database calls per page
Cache public, read-heavy rows where appropriate
Ensure sliders remain smooth under large datasets
Media & Assets
Optimize poster and backdrop image loading
Ensure fast player initialization
Eliminate unnecessary re-renders during playback
2) SCALING & INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING (REQUIRED)
Rate Limiting
Implement server-side rate limits for:
Authentication
Uploads
Posting/comments
Creator actions
Database
Audit and add indexes for:
Titles
Playback progress
Comments
Events
Optimize slow queries
Ensure queries scale with large row counts
Background Work
Introduce background jobs / queues only if needed for:
Upload status updates
Moderation actions
Cleanup tasks
Keep this minimal.
3) MONITORING & RELIABILITY (REQUIRED)
Add production-ready monitoring:
Error Tracking
Integrate error tracking (e.g., Sentry or equivalent)
Capture:
Frontend runtime errors
API/server errors
Player failures
Logging
Log key events:
Playback start
Playback errors
Upload failures
Ad errors (if ads enabled)
Logs must be structured and queryable.
4) SECURITY HARDENING (REQUIRED)
Access Control
Verify admin routes are fully protected by role
Ensure creator/admin separation is enforced
Supabase Security
Review and verify all RLS policies
Ensure no public write access where unintended
Validate role-based access paths
Environment & Server Safety
Secure environment variables
Lock down server routes
Prevent abuse of upload and post endpoints
5) APPS PREPARATION (REQUIRED, NO APP BUILDING)
TV / Remote Readiness
Ensure keyboard and remote navigation is consistent across:
Homepage
Sliders
Theater Mode
Community panels
Focus state must be:
Predictable
Visible
Preserved across navigation
Back behavior must be consistent everywhere
Mobile Preparation
Verify responsive layouts across breakpoints
Ensure Theater Mode works cleanly on mobile
PWA readiness may be prepared, but not shipped
⚠️ Do not build native apps.
Only prepare the codebase so apps are feasible later.
6) ANALYTICS & DIAGNOSTICS (REQUIRED)
Confirm analytics events fire correctly:
Plays
Completions
Errors
Ensure analytics does not block playback or UI
Keep analytics lightweight and non-invasive
7) OUT OF SCOPE — DO NOT BUILD
❌ Native mobile apps
❌ TV apps
❌ Internationalization
❌ ML recommendations
❌ UI redesigns
❌ New content features
8) PHASE 5 ACCEPTANCE CHECKPOINTS
All must pass to mark Phase 5 complete:
Performance
Fast homepage load
Smooth sliders with large datasets
Reliable, fast player start
Reliability
Errors captured and visible
Logs show playback and failures
Security
Admin routes locked
RLS policies verified
Abuse protections effective
App Readiness
Keyboard/remote navigation polished end-to-end
Focus and back behavior consistent
Mobile experience verified
Final Instruction
This is the last phase.
Prioritize stability, clarity, and correctness over speed.
Think carefully before coding.
If a change risks breaking completed phases, do not implement it.
