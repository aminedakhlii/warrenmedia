Phase 4: Community (Cinema-First, Non-Noisy)
You are extending an existing cinema-first streaming platform.
Phase 4 adds light community features that complement viewing without turning the product into a social network.
⚠️ This phase must not redesign, reframe, or dominate the viewing experience.
Community is secondary, contained, and quiet.
Global Rules (Non-Negotiable)
No homepage social feed
Community must never interrupt playback
Theater Mode remains primary and unchanged
No infinite scroll feeds
No autoplay content
No UI clutter or visual noise
If a feature is not explicitly listed, do not build it
Phase 4 Goals

Add basic moderation controls
Keep community contained and optional

Comments attach to:
a title
optionally an episode (if episode context exists)
No global comment feed
Display Locations (choose one, keep simple)

Inside a title detail panel (if one exists)
Behavior
Sort order:
newest-first OR most recent activity (choose one)
No nested threads beyond 1 level (flat list preferred)
